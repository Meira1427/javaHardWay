HALLWAY
You are in a large circular room with five brightly colored doors. The room 
is humid, muggy, and unpleasant. You wish to leave. Choose a door.

The "red" door is tall and warm to the touch.
When you near the rounded "yellow" door, you hear a deep snore.
The "blue" door is short and narrow with a glass handle.
The "purple" door is stylish with black accents.
Faint music comes from behind the arched "green" door.

RED
You enter a room built out of red bricks. Two tables are set for dinner. 
A fire pit, with a gently crackling fire, is on the far end of the room. 
A blob of pizza dough and the makings for a pizza are spread out on a wooden 
table near the fire pit.

You can choose to make a "pizza" or go "back".

YELLOW
You step into a dim cave with a sleeping dragon. Bones and random items of 
treasure litter the floor. The door slams behind you and the dragon awakens. 
He doesn't look very happy.

You can choose to "feed" the dragon, "fight" the dragon, or "pet" the dragon.
Or you can try the door handle and go "back".

PURPLE
This room has off-white walls, lavendar carpet, and black furniture. In one 
corner, a large desk with a leather chair holds a computer and some books.

You can sit down and look at the "computer" or go "back".

GREEN
You step outdoors into a beautiful garden with large trees and flowering 
plants. You walk along a path until you come upon a comfortable chair near 
a fountain. A book is lying on a table next to a glass of water. It looks 
comfortable.

You can take a "nap", read the "book", or go "back".

PIZZA
A blind, old man with a service dog emerges from the shadows. He smiles and
thanks you for making the pizza. You invite him to sit down and share the meal
with you, also setting out a plate for his dog. He tells you stories about his
life while you dine. He is grateful for your hospitality and friendship. At 
the end of the meal, he pulls from his pocket the keys to a classic Jaguar 
convertible. Obviously, he cannot drive, so he offers the car to you.

A sign on the wall says that the dragon only eats grass fed cows and an 
occasional human. Do you have any grass fed cows?

FIGHT
You are a brave person. A jewel-encrusted sword lies six feet to your right. 
You grab the sword and swing it around wildly. The dragon is neither impressed 
nor amused. It is all or nothing now, so you lunge, pointing the sword between 
the dragon's eyes. A direct hit! The dragon falls. As you recover, you notice the 
sound of voices behind a door that was previously hidden by the dragon. You open 
the door and out pour a dozen children of various ages. They explain that they 
have been prisoners of the dragon for many months. You pull out your cell phone, 
call the authorities, and let the older children call their parents. 

Many hours later, grateful parents reunite with their children, lavish you with 
awards, and the mayor of the city invites you to a celebration in your honor.

PET
You're one of those touchy-feely types, aren't you? THIS is a BAD idea. 
You lose your arm. You're lucky it's not your life.

YES_COW
You magically produce a grass fed cow which satisfies the dragon. He is lulled 
to sleep. Before he begins to snore, you hear the faint sound of voices behind 
a door on the far side of the room. Tiptoeing, so as to not awaken the  dragon, 
you open the door. Inside are a dozen children of various ages. They explain that 
they have been prisoners of the dragon for many months. You pull out your cell phone, 
call the authorities, and let the older children call their parents. Problem is, 
you are now all trapped in this room behind the dragon.

No worries. A SWAT team arrives, takes out the dragon, and rescues you and 
the children.

NO_COW
Naturally, you don't have a grass fed cow. Realizing that the dragon is willing 
to eat the occasional human, you have no choice but to go back. Unfortunately, 
the door is stuck. You need to rethink the options. What were they?

"Feed" the dragon, "Fight" the dragon, "Pet" the dragon.

BATH
You settle in to a hot bath and enjoy the view. As you rest, your mind drifts, 
and you imagine the plot for a blockbuster movie. As the water cools, you are
refreshed and ready to write.

COMPUTER
You sit down at the desk and look at the computer. A PDF for 'Learn Java the 
Hard Way' is up on the screen. You peruse the book, do the exercises, and find 
you really have a knack for computer programming. You spend night and day in this 
room. (Stopping only to make yourself an occasional pizza). You love coding so much 
that you begin to search for a coding boot camp. Since you know Java is the bomb, 
the choice is easy. You manage to get accepted by the Skill Distillery in Colorado 
and begin to plan your future.
